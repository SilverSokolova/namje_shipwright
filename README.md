### This framework requires [OpenStarbound](https://github.com/OpenStarbound/OpenStarbound)

A BYOS and ship-swapping framework.

Steam Link(tba)

## Features

### FU Compatiblity

This framework will automatically detect Frackin Universe and patch most things to use their BYOS system instead.

### Cargo Hold

Ships come with a custom cargo hold separate from the ship locker. The cargo hold is a custom inventory tied to the shipworld, and has a variable storage size based on the ship.    
The cargo hold is optional, and ships can exclude it.
